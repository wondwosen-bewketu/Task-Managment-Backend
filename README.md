# Project Name: Fidle Labs Task Management System

A comprehensive backend solution for managing tasks, subtasks, and statuses with out authentication, task creation, and status management. This API is built with **NestJS**, leveraging modern practices such as modular architecture, unit testing, and input validation. It also integrates with external services and supports Docker for containerization.

## About

This is a task management API that enables users to create, update, and manage tasks and subtasks  and file managment . It provides a flexible system for task categorization and state management, as well as user authentication via JWT tokens. The project follows **RESTful** principles and is designed for scalability and ease of maintenance.

## Features


- **Task Management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete tasks. Tasks can have different statuses (e.g., "to-do", "in progress", "completed").
- **Subtask Management**: Create, retrieve, update, and delete subtasks within tasks.
- **Search & Filtering**: Filter tasks based on attributes such as status, priority, and due date.
- **Task Status Updates**: Dynamically update task statuses with corresponding API routes.
- **Pagination**: Support for pagination when listing tasks to improve performance.
- **File Management**: Upload and download files using Cloudinary integration.
- **Docker Support**: Containerized app for easy deployment.
- **API Documentation**: Auto-generated API docs using Swagger.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend Framework**: [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) (Node.js)
- **Database**: MongoDB (with Mongoose ORM)
- **Validation**: Class-Validator (for input validation)
- **Testing**: Jest, Supertest (for API testing)
- **Documentation**: Swagger (for interactive API docs)
- **Containerization**: Docker
- **Environment Variables**: dotenv

## Installation

### Requirements
To run this project locally, you need to have the following installed:

- Node.js (v20 or higher)
- Docker (optional for containerization)
- MongoDB (or use a cloud database like MongoDB Atlas)

### Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/wondwosen-bewketu/Task-Managment-Backend.git
   cd Task-Managment-Backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables:**

   Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in the necessary values:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

   Example `.env`:
   ```
   JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
   MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/task-management
   ```

4. **Run the application locally:**
   ```bash
   pnpm dev 
   pnpm start
   ```

   This will start the server on `http://localhost:3000` or by your port name.
